## Challenges

Key challenges when creating this webpage are the fact that it's responsive, and a number of elements 
on the page change depending on the screen size. Other challenges involve creating the smooth, well
styled animations that bring life to this site.

Key animations / interactivity that I need to create are:
- The Nav bar which fades in and out on scroll (when the screen width is > 768px);
- Responsive features of webpage (layout of project pictures & expandable nav items);
- Fade in each of the listed projects once the projects enter the viewport.
- On hover over a project the an almost opaque screen covers the picture and the project
  title is shown.
- Show magnified picture of project photo on click.

## Issues encountered

- Setting up font-awesome to work with Sass. 
  
  I wanted to be able to work offline when required, and so didn't want to depend on a CDN. 
  To get Sass working nicely with font-awesome I need to add the font-awesome fonts to the 
  font folder in my distribution folder, and also needed to add just the sass files to the sass 
  folder, which I've now done, and then imported it into the top of my sass application.scss file
  with the other external libraries that I've used.   

- Creating responsive navbar

  Achieved with waypoint.js and CSS transitions
