# Templates

----

## Introduction

This repo contains various templates that I am cloning from scratch (i.e. I've used visuals to recreate, but 
haven't reused any of the underling code).

The majority of the templates I will clone will be from [FreeCSS](http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates "FreeCSS") and
these are all contained in the FreeCSS folder. Where I clone other templates and folders, these will be contained in their
own distinctive folders.

Each item in these folders contains two folders, a _public_ folder with my code in, and an _inspiration_ folder 
with images and source code of the website that I'm trying to recreate.

I will also use this as an exercise to help discover some of the tools / libraries used to create the websites. I will 
keep a list of this libraries below and will make my own notes about these additional tools. Where I use other libraries
I will also make note of these.

While some websites will use frameworks such as [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap") I, initially, will seek to 
avoid such comprehensive libraries, as I seek to improve my own CSS and HTML skills and utilising bootstrap and the like too 
often would defeat the purpose of these exercises.

I will utilise SASS to write my CSS, and will also leverage jQuery in places. Later templates, I may create using React, but 
initially, for these projects, I want to focus on writing as much HTML and Sassy CSS as possible.
