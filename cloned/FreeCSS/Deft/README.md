# Deft

## Introduction

This is the third template I intend on cloning. I really love the design of this page and intend on using it to inspire my own personal portfolio.

There are a number of pages included in this file, but they represent different pages for different purposes. For this exercise I will focus on the Agency.html page.




## Page Components, Style and Structure

- General: Unlike the other two templates that I've cloned thus far, this template is fairly distinct. It uses a number of different libraries that I'm yet to encounter
and also has a different page structure, with the look and feel of a half scrollable SPA.

The left of the page is fixed and fairly plain in design while all the content and links are on the right hand side of the page. The projects on being clicked slide in additional project detail
once the relevant section is clicked. It also has a contact form, which I'll wire up like I did with the Minifolio template, and have any messages flow through to my actual database (will be mongodb).
